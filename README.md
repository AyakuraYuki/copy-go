# copy-go

copy-go copies files or directories

Forked from [otiai10/copy](https://github.com/otiai10/copy), I utilized `bufio` to wrap the reader and writer.

Please use the original lib [otiai10/copy](https://github.com/otiai10/copy).
This lib has been adapted to suit my personal preferences and may not be suitable for everyone.

## Attention

64-BIT OPERATING SYSTEM IS REQUIRED
